* New option in the job detail view to export non-cracked hashes to file.
* New column 'Est. remaining time' in the job workunits view, which is based on estimated end time computed by hashcat.
* Added possibility to select device types (CPU or GPU) to be used for cracking in 'Host settings'.
* Added possibility to change hashcat's workload profile in 'Host settings'.
* Added possibility to enable hashcat's slow candidates mode for dictionary, combinator and brute force attacks in 'Attack settings'.
